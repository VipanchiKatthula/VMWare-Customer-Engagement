# VM Ware-Customer-Engagement

## OBJECTIVE - Improving customer engagement at VMWare through Analytics
1. To find a model with parameters to show the estimates of performance that could be shared with business.
2. Prove that the model could be implemented in the real world so that the business could be convinced of the benifits.
3. Suggest future extensions to this model that the business can incorporate to improve its performance.

## Data and Description
The data consists of 700+ variables from 500+ potential customers from VMWare's web analytics team. As the dataset is confidential, I cannot share the data I received here on GitHub as opensource. However, you can always buy the project from ISB's publication content sharing website.

## Analysis
Selected significant variables through thorough exploratory analysis. Then cleaned the data in R and the code file can be accessed [here](https://github.com/VipanchiKatthula/VMWare-Customer-Engagement/blob/master/code/Project%20Code.R)
